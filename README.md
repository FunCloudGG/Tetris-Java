# Tetris-Jva
This is my first project written in Java.   I developed it in just 4 days as a way to practice object-oriented programming, basic game logic, and working with graphics in Java Swing.   The game includes piece rotation, line clearing, and score tracking.  It was a fun challenge and a great starting point for my journey into Java development.
